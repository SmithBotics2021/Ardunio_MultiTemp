# Ardunio_MultiTemp
SmithBotics modified Arduino Sketch that uses NTC Thermistors to measure multiple Battery Pack Cell Temps

This is a basic Arduino Sketch that utilizes multiple NTC 100K Thermistors and corresponding resistors that will allow an Arduino to monitor multiple temperature locations within a battery pack, but you may have other specific uses, of course. 

This sketch is modified from a version that Scott Campbell of CircuitBasics.com had put out there and changes have been made just to allow for the additional temperature zone readings as well as a small delay to allow enough time to reach each zone's temp. 

Hopefully those in need of such a sketch will benefit from this, so putting it out there just for that possibility.
